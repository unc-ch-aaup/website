      UNC-CH AAUP statement<br>against changes to chancellor searches
    </h2>
  </header>
  <p>
    The officers of the UNC-Chapel Hill Chapter of the American
    Association of University Professors (AAUP) strongly condemn an
    unprecedented policy revision that will be proposed to the Board of
    Governors of the University of North Carolina this Thursday, September
    17, 2020.
  </p>
  <p>
    The proposal has two parts. First, in any local campus’s search for a
    new chancellor, the UNC System President will have the power to insert
    two candidates, regardless of that campus’s wishes or needs. Second,
    the UNC President can require that those two candidates be put forward
    for consideration by that campus’s Board of Trustees, again without
    attention to the recommendations of that campus’s faculty and
    administration.
  </p>
  <p>
    This proposal, if approved, will grant the system president undue
    influence over individual campuses and gut the principle of shared
    governance, which has guided the North Carolina university system
    since 1931. The changes threaten efforts on individual campuses to
    build trusting and locally relevant relationships among stakeholders
    and will discourage high quality candidates from applying because the
    results can be easily overridden or will not reflect campus goals.
  </p>
  <p>
    When individual campuses seek input from stakeholders, listen to that
    input, and use it in important decision making processes, this shared
    governance strengthens everyone's confidence in the process, the
    institution, and in the outcomes of those decisions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The UNC-Chapel Hill officers join AAUP chapters at UNC-Greensboro and
    East Carolina University and the UNC Greensboro Faculty Senate in
    strenuous opposition to this proposal. We call upon our own and all
    system campus leaders to fight this proposal.
  </p>

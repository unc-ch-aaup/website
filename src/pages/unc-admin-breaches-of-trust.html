      UNC-CH AAUP statement on<br>
      UNC administrators' serial breaches of trust
    </h2>
  </header>
  <p>
    The UNC campus community learned last week that the University’s
    pay-off to the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV)—$74,999 to stay away
    from the Chapel Hill campus plus $2.5 million to relocate the Silent
    Sam statue—was not negotiated by a 5-person subcommittee of the UNC
    Board of Governors (BOG), as previously reported. Instead, the
    November 2019 settlement was reached by UNC-system lawyers, the SCV's
    lawyer, and

      >high-ranking member</a> of the Chancellor's Cabinet and
    a former aide to legislator Tim Moore. This news means that interim
    Chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz was either inexcusably ignorant or
    deliberately dishonest in front of a large audience at the Faculty
    Council meeting in December of 2019, when he insisted that "we [at
    Chapel Hill] were not consulted" about and did not “weigh in” on the
    decision. One week later the

      >BOG named Guskiewicz</a> the permanent

  <p>
    UNC's dissembling in the SCV case is not unprecedented under the
    Guskiewicz administration. Just one month before the interim
    chancellor's performance at Faculty Council, UNC-Chapel Hill
    released a Department of Education report showing the
    institution's blatant disregard for sexual assault victims and
    violations of the Clery Act, dating back at least as far as
    2013. Although the report was delivered to the University in
    August 2019, the institution informed the public only on November
    18,

    Observer."</a>
  </p>

    In August 2020, we learned from the media that the chancellor and the
    provost failed to reveal to the faculty or the public the contents of
    an

    >Orange County Health Department memo</a> recommending online-only
    instruction for the first five weeks of the fall semester and
    significantly reducing density in UNC’s dorms. The University rejected
    those recommendations. Faculty Chair Mimi Chapman described UNC
    leaders’ deceptive tactics as a

      >"serious breach of trust."</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    In the wake of revelations about the SCV settlement, law professor
    Eric Muller used similar language. The chancellor's duplicity, if
    it could not somehow be explained, "would feel like

      >a breach of confidence to me, a breach of trust.”</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    The members of UNC’s AAUP chapter agree. The serial dishonesty
    displayed by the chancellor and his associates regarding the most
    sensitive and important matters confronting the University in
    recent years has eroded our confidence in UNC's
    leadership. Transparency and faculty participation form the
    bedrock of effective

    the campus forward with mutual trust and a realistic prospect of
    shared problem-solving, we urge Chancellor Guskiewicz, and others
    who have contributed to UNC’s pattern of institutional dishonesty,
    to step down.
